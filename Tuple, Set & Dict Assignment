Q1. What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?

Tuples are collection of elements which are orderd and inmmutable. 
following are the characterstics of tuples
1. its item are indexed
2.It can contains duplicate values
3. It can contains all types of elements such as numbers, integer, strings,boolean values.

Q2. What are the two tuple methods in python? Give an example of each method. Give a reason why
tuples have only two in-built methods as compared to Lists.

#Two tuple methods in python are count() and index()
t=(1.2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,1,1,2,2)
t.count(3)
t.index(1)

# Tuples have only tow in built methods as compare to list because tuples are immutable. They connot be alterd afrer it is created


Q3. Which collection datatypes in python do not allow duplicate items? Write a code using a set to remove
duplicates from the given list.

List = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 4]

## 'set' is collection of datatype in python which donot allow duplicate items. 

#To remove duplicates form the given dataset 

unique_set=set(List)
unique_set

Q4. Explain the difference between the union() and update() methods for a set. Give an example of
each method.

# the main difference between the union() and update() for a set is that it create and return a new set while leaving
# the orignal set unchanged, whereas update() changes the orignal set in place and does not return anything.

a={1,2,3}
b={3,4,5}

# using update()
a.update(b)

b |= a

#now 'a' and 'b' are same

Q5. What is a dictionary? Give an example. Also, state whether a dictionary is ordered or unordered.

# dictionary is a collection which allows data in key value pairs. where a key is unique identifier for a vlaue 
# and value can be any data type. dictonary is ordered.

# to create a dictionary of fruits and their prices
fruits = {"apple": 0.99, "banana": 0.49, "cherry": 1.29}


Q6. Can we create a nested dictionary? If so, please give an example by creating a simple one-level
nested dictionary.

#Yes, we can create a nested dictonary. 

students = {
    "Alice": {"Math": 90, "Science": 85, "English": 95},
    "Bob": {"Math": 80, "Science": 75, "English": 88},
    "Charlie": {"Math": 92, "Science": 89, "English": 91}
}
students

# print Alice's math grade
print(students["Alice"]["Science"]) # prints 90

Q7. Using setdefault() method, create key named topics in the given dictionary and also add the value of
the key as this list ['Python', 'Machine Learning’, 'Deep Learning']

dict1 = {'language' : 'Python', 'course': 'Data Science Masters'}

# use setdefault() method to create topics key and assign a list as its value
dict1.setdefault('topics', ['Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning'])

dict1




Q8. What are the three view objects in dictionaries? Use the three in-built methods in python to display
these three view objects for the given dictionary.

dict1 = {'Sport': 'Cricket' , 'Teams': ['India', 'Australia', 'England', 'South Africa', 'Sri Lanka', 'New Zealand']}

#Three view opjects in dictionaries are 'keys', 'values' and 'items'.

# display the keys view object
dict1.keys()


# display the values view object
dict1.values()

# display the items view obje
dict1.items()
